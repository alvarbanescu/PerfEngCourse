# Data warnings

The following should be taken into account when using this data:

 * Evaluations for the years 2019 and 2022 were lost.
 * Data for the years 2017 and 2018 covered all assignments in one, rather than
   having questions for the individual assignments. We have chosen to duplicate
   the global assignment score in these years as the scores for all assignments
   separately.
 * The evaluations for year 2020 did not include questions about learning
   outcomes.
 * In all cases, metrics are selected on their relevance to assessing the
   quality of the course itself, as compared to assessing the lecturers and
   TAs, etc. This means that the data is naturally a biased selection of the
   whole evaluations which are broader in scope.
