# PerfEngCourse
Performance Engineering Course from University of Amsterdam 

This repository contains teaching materials for the Performance Engineering course as taught at University of Amsterdam in 2022. 

## Contents

This repository contains a variety of files, organised into directories as
follows:

 * `assignments/` contains the four assignments students are given, and
   includes the code frameworks in which the assignments are to be completed.
 * `data/` contains structured data about grades, evaluations, and enrollment
   over the years the course was taught.
 * `scripts/` contains Python code to generate plots and tables for our paper.
   These scripts use the `data/` directory.
 * `slides/` contains the lecture slides for the course.

## Using this artifact

Most of this artifact comes "pre-baked", e.g. the slides and assignment
documents are provided as-is. The same goes for the data directory. In order to
(re-)generate the plots and tables in our paper, please see the separate README
in the `scripts/` directory.
